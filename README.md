# Project Description
Looking at past cryptocurrency trends using 'DataJuicers cryptodatabase' to build a prediction modeler. The .csv file contains ticks for all tradable currecies (bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, ripple) beginning 2018-08-15.

## Summary of Questions:
Questions and deeper meanings we would like to uncover include which currency provides the best average returns for investments, are trends consistent amongst various groups/countries, unique correlations which can potentially be linked to our predictions, can we accurately forecast using our prediction models? Similarly, does a USD dollar increase in Bitcoin lead to a similar increase across a basket of currency indices.
